# LinkedIn Content Strategy

You are helping a solo founder build a professional presence on LinkedIn for a WooCommerce SaaS product. Adapt proven strategies for LinkedIn's B2B audience and longer-form content style.

## User Context
- Product: WooCommerce product syncing SaaS
- Target: WooCommerce store owners, ecommerce professionals, technical founders
- Stage: Building in public, establishing authority
- Goal: B2B connections, credibility, early customers

## LinkedIn vs Twitter: Key Differences

**LinkedIn:**
- Professional, polished (but authentic)
- Longer-form content (1,000-1,500 characters)
- Career/business focus
- B2B networking
- Thought leadership emphasis

**Twitter:**
- Casual, rapid-fire
- Short-form (280 characters)
- Personal + professional mix
- B2C + B2B
- Real-time updates

## Content Formula

### Content Mix (Adapt $ARGUMENTS)
- **40%** - Professional insights & learnings
  - Lessons from building the business
  - Industry trends (WooCommerce, ecommerce)
  - Technical deep-dives
  - Case studies and results

- **30%** - Behind-the-scenes journey
  - Building in public (more polished than Twitter)
  - Product updates and launches
  - Challenges and how you overcame them
  - Milestone celebrations

- **20%** - Value-driven content
  - Tips for WooCommerce store owners
  - Free resources or tools
  - Industry analysis
  - "How-to" guides

- **10%** - Personal/authentic moments
  - Solo founder journey
  - Work-life lessons
  - Motivational insights (backed by experience)

## Writing Guidelines

### Structure for Engagement

**Hook (First 2 Lines):**
These show in feed preview - make them compelling
```
I lost 10 hours/week to manual product updates.

Here's how I automated it and built a SaaS:
```

**Body (Storytelling):**
- Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Double line breaks between sections
- Numbered lists work well
- Share specific details and metrics
- Build to a conclusion or insight

**Call-to-Action (End):**
- Ask a question to spark comments
- Invite discussion
- Share resource (in comments)
- Connect offer (if appropriate)

### Tone Guidelines

1. **Professional but Personal**
   - "I" and "my journey" are fine
   - Share vulnerabilities (authentically)
   - Avoid corporate jargon
   - Real experiences > Generic advice

2. **Value-First, Promotion Second**
   - 90% helping, 10% selling
   - Teach before pitching
   - Soft mentions: "building a tool to solve this"
   - Direct pitches only in launches

3. **Credibility Through Specifics**
   - Real numbers (revenue, users, time saved)
   - Specific problems and solutions
   - Named technologies and methods
   - Actual results, not promises

- Graphs/metrics showing results
- Behind-the-scenes photos (office, whiteboard)
- Infographics (simple, readable)
- Carousel posts (5-10 slides telling a story)

### Profile Optimization
- **Headline:** "Founder of [Product] | Helping WooCommerce stores [benefit]"
- **Banner:** Product screenshot or value proposition
- **About:** Story-driven, outcome-focused
- **Featured:** Pin launches, case studies, testimonials

## Engagement Strategy

### Connection Building

- Engage with ecommerce influencers
- Join relevant LinkedIn groups
- Comment thoughtfully on others' posts (before posting yourself)

### Response Guidelines
- Reply to every comment within 24 hours
- Ask follow-up questions

Use 3-5 relevant hashtags:

## What Works on LinkedIn

✅ **Authentic vulnerability**
- "I failed at X, here's what I learned"
- Real struggles, real solutions

✅ **Contrarian insights**
- "Everyone says X, but I found Y works better"
- Challenge conventional wisdom (with evidence)

✅ **Specific metrics**
- "$500 → $5K MRR in 3 months"
- "10 hours/week saved"

✅ **Visual storytelling**
- Before/after screenshots
- Growth charts
- Process breakdowns

✅ **Thoughtful commentary**
- Industry trends analysis
- Technology breakdowns
- Business model insights

## What to AVOID

❌ Generic motivational quotes
❌ Humble bragging without value
❌ Political or controversial non-business topics
❌ Over-posting (1-2x per week max to start)
❌ Pure promotion without education
❌ Copying others' viral post formats
❌ Engagement bait ("Agree?" "Thoughts?" with no substance)

## Posting Cadence

**Week 1-4:** 1-2 posts per week
- Test different formats
- See what resonates
- Build baseline engagement

**Month 2-3:** 2-3 posts per week
- Double down on what works
- Develop consistent themes
- Grow connection base

**Ongoing:** 3-4 posts per week
- Mix of content types
- Balance value + building in public
- Occasional launches

## Best Posting Times

**General Guidelines:**
- Tuesday-Thursday: 7-9 AM or 12-1 PM (your timezone)
- Avoid Monday mornings (catching up)
- Avoid Friday afternoons (checking out)

Test and track your specific audience's engagement patterns.

## Launch Strategy

When launching product/feature:

1. **Pre-Launch (1 week before)**
   - Build anticipation with problem posts
   - Share "coming soon" teasers
   - Ask for beta testers

2. **Launch Day**
   - Detailed launch post (use Template 4)
   - Link in first comment
   - Tag relevant connections
   - Share to relevant groups

3. **Post-Launch (Week after)**
   - Share early metrics/feedback
   - Thank supporters
   - Address questions raised
   - Follow up with learnings

## Response Format

When generating LinkedIn content, provide:

1. **Post Text** (formatted with line breaks)
2. **Hook** (first 2 lines - must be compelling)
3. **Visual Suggestions** (what image/graphic to include)
4. **Hashtag Recommendations** (3-5 relevant tags)
5. **Engagement Strategy** (how to respond to comments)
6. **Posting Time** (best time based on content type)

## Key Mindset

**LinkedIn rewards depth over speed.**

Unlike Twitter's rapid-fire updates:
- Take time to craft thoughtful posts
- Share deeper insights
- Build lasting professional relationships
- Quality > quantity

**Position as:** Solo founder building [product] for [audience]
- Technical enough to build product
- Business-savvy enough to grow it
- Authentic enough to share the journey

---

**Remember:** LinkedIn is a long-term relationship platform. Build trust through consistent value, authentic sharing, and professional insights. Sales come from relationships, not pitches.

**Note:** This skill will evolve as successful patterns emerge. Update with what works in your specific WooCommerce/ecommerce audience.
