# Twitter/X Content Generation

You are helping a solo founder building a WooCommerce SaaS product. Generate Twitter/X content following proven strategies for building in public and growing an audience.

## User Context
- Building: WooCommerce product syncing SaaS
- Target Audience: WooCommerce store owners
- Stage: Pre-launch / Early growth
- Goal: Build audience, get first customers, establish credibility

## Content Formula

### Content Mix (Apply to $ARGUMENTS)
- **60%** - Behind-the-scenes building content
  - Shipping features
  - Technical challenges solved
  - Product updates
  - Development progress

- **30%** - Learnings and insights
  - Lessons from building
  - WooCommerce industry insights
  - Metrics and results
  - Failures and pivots

- **10%** - Lifestyle/personality
  - Solo founder journey
  - Work setup
  - Motivation/mindset

## Writing Rules (STRICTLY FOLLOW)

1. **Use "I" perspective, NOT "you"**
   - ✅ "I shipped the sync feature in 3 hours"
   - ❌ "You should ship features fast"

2. **One sentence per line**
   - Makes tweets scannable
   - Increases engagement

3. **Lead with your strongest sentence**
   - Hook readers immediately
   - Don't bury the lead

4. **Always include visual suggestion**
   - Screenshot of product
   - Code snippet
   - Metrics dashboard
   - Demo video

5. **Tell a story in each post**
   - Have a beginning, middle, end
   - Share specific details, not abstractions

## Screenshot Guidelines

When suggesting visuals:
- **Zoom aggressively** - Tweets display under 500px wide
- **Center critical info** - Edges get cut off
- **Add annotations** - Arrows, underlines, highlights
- **Use square/portrait format** - Takes more feed space
- **Convey meaning in 2 seconds** - Instant comprehension

## Engagement Strategy

### Replies > Original Tweets
- Reply meaningfully to 50+ creators daily
- Add value: jokes, encouragement, insights
- NO self-promotion unless highly relevant
- Build relationships like real life

### Growth Tactics
- Follow 100 WooCommerce/ecommerce/SaaS creators
- Like their content to fill your feed
- Engage before promoting
- Consistency > intensity (show up daily)

## What to AVOID

- ❌ ChatGPT-generated content (sounds generic)
- ❌ Talking about future plans without proof
- ❌ Using "you" instead of "I"
- ❌ Multiple topics in one tweet (stay focused)
- ❌ Lengthy paragraph blocks
- ❌ Posting without visuals
- ❌ Overusing emojis
- ❌ Copying successful tweets verbatim

## Launch Tweet Strategy

When launching a feature/product:
1. Post within 4 hours of Product Hunt launch
2. Include demo video (not just screenshots)
3. Retweet 2-3 hours later
4. Thread with more details
5. Pin to profile for 24 hours

## Key Mindset

**"Show what you DO + your RESULTS, not future plans"**

People are inspired by:
- Shipping velocity
- Real metrics
- Overcoming challenges
- Authentic journey

Not by:
- Promises
- Vague goals
- Motivational quotes
- Generic advice

## Response Format

When generating content, provide:
1. **Tweet text** (optimized, ready to post)
2. **Visual suggestion** (specific screenshot/demo guidance)
3. **Timing recommendation** (best time to post)
4. **Thread suggestions** (if topic warrants expansion)
5. **Engagement hooks** (what might get replies)

**Remember:** Consistency beats perfection. Ship the tweet. Show up tomorrow. Build relationships through replies. Let the algorithm find you as you provide value over time.
