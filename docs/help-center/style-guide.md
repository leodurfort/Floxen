# Floxen Help Center Style Guide

This style guide ensures consistency across all Floxen help center articles. Follow these guidelines when creating or editing documentation.

---

## Product Overview

**Floxen** helps ecommerce brands display their products in ChatGPT by synchronizing their product catalog between WooCommerce and ChatGPT.

**Target audience:** Non-technical small business owners (merchants) running ecommerce stores.

---

## Terminology

Use these terms consistently across all articles:

| Term | Definition | Usage |
|------|------------|-------|
| **Product** | One WooCommerce product | "Select the product you want to sync" |
| **Item** | One product variation (e.g., a shoe in a specific color and size) | "Each product may have multiple items based on its variations" |
| **Store** | One WooCommerce store | "Connect your Store to Floxen" |
| **Merchant** | The Floxen user | "As a merchant, you can..." |

### Terms to Avoid

| Don't use | Use instead |
|-----------|-------------|
| User | Merchant |
| Shop | Store |
| Variant | Item |
| Website | Store |

---

## Tone & Voice

### Core Principles

1. **Accessible** - Write for non-technical readers. Avoid jargon; if a technical term is necessary, define it inline.
2. **Reassuring** - Merchants may feel overwhelmed. Use calm, supportive language.
3. **Direct** - Get to the point. Respect the merchant's time.
4. **Empowering** - Help merchants solve problems themselves. Frame instructions as achievable steps.
5. **Professional with personality** - Maintain professionalism while allowing occasional warmth (e.g., "and you're all set!").

### Voice Examples

| Instead of | Write |
|------------|-------|
| "The system will process your request" | "Floxen syncs your products automatically" |
| "Users must configure settings" | "Set up your preferences in a few clicks" |
| "Error: Invalid API key" | "Your API key doesn't seem to be working. Let's fix that." |
| "It is recommended that..." | "We recommend..." |
| "Please be advised that..." | Simply state the information |

### Reassuring Language

Use phrases that reduce anxiety:

- "This only takes a minute"
- "Don't worry - your data is safe"
- "You can always change this later"
- "If something doesn't look right, we're here to help"

## Article Structure

### Standard Components

Every article should include:

1. **Title** — Clear, action-oriented or question-based
2. **Introduction** — 1-2 sentences explaining what the article covers and why it matters
3. **Body** — Main content organized with headings
4. **Next steps or related articles** — Guide merchants to logical next actions

### Heading Hierarchy

```
# Article Title (H1) - Only one per article

## Main Section (H2) - Major topic divisions

### Subsection (H3) - Breakdowns within sections

#### Detail (H4) - Rarely needed, use sparingly
```

### Article Types & Templates

**Structure:**
1. Brief intro explaining the goal
2. Prerequisites (if any)
3. Numbered step-by-step instructions
4. Confirmation of success ("You'll know it worked when...")
5. Next steps

**Example title:** "Connecting Your WooCommerce Store to Floxen"

## Formatting Rules

### Text Formatting

| Element | Format | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| UI elements (buttons, tabs, menu items) | **Bold** | Click **Save Changes** |
| Page names and sections | **Bold** | Go to the **Settings** page |
| Key terms on first use | **Bold** | Your **Store** is your WooCommerce installation |
| Emphasis | *Italics* | This step is *optional* |
| Exact values to enter | "Quotes" | Enter "floxen-sync" in the field |

### Lists

**Use numbered lists for sequential steps:**

1. Go to your Floxen dashboard
2. Click **Products** in the sidebar
3. Select the products you want to sync
4. Click **Sync Now**

**Use bullet points for non-sequential items:**

- Product title
- Price
- Description
- Images
- Inventory status

**Nest lists sparingly.** If you need more than two levels, consider restructuring the content.

### Callouts

Use emoji prefixes for important information:

**Tips (helpful suggestions):**
> **Tip:** You can sync up to 100 products at once by selecting multiple items.

**Warnings (potential problems):**
> **Warning:** Disconnecting your Store will pause all syncs. Your existing items in ChatGPT will remain but won't receive updates.

### Links

- Use descriptive link text, not "click here"
- Link to related articles when relevant

| Don't write | Write |
|-------------|-------|
| "Click here for more info" | "Learn more about sync settings" |
| "See this article" | "See Managing Your Products" |

---

## Writing Guidelines

### Sentence Structure

- Keep sentences short (under 25 words when possible)
- Use active voice: "Floxen syncs your products" not "Your products are synced by Floxen"
- Start instructions with verbs: "Click," "Select," "Enter," "Go to"
- One instruction per step

### Characters to Avoid

| Don't use | Use instead |
|-----------|-------------|
| — (em dash) | - (hyphen) or rewrite the sentence |

### Explaining Technical Concepts

When a technical term is necessary, define it inline:

> "Each product can have multiple **items** - these are individual variations like different sizes or colors."

### Numbers

- Spell out one through nine
- Use numerals for 10 and above
- Always use numerals for: steps, prices, percentages, time

### Common Phrases

| Situation | Phrase to use |
|-----------|---------------|
| Starting instructions | "To [goal], follow these steps:" |
| Confirming success | "You'll know it worked when..." |
| Offering alternatives | "Alternatively, you can..." |
| Noting optional steps | "*(Optional)*" at the start of the step |
| Time estimates | "This takes about [X] minutes" |
| Ending articles | "You're all set!" or "That's it!" |

## Examples

### Good Introduction

> **Connecting Your WooCommerce Store to Floxen**
>
> Before Floxen can sync your products to ChatGPT, you need to connect your WooCommerce Store. This takes about two minutes and only needs to be done once.

### Good Step-by-Step Instructions

> ## Adding Products to Your Sync
>
> 1. Go to your Floxen dashboard
> 2. Click **Products** in the left sidebar
> 3. Select the products you want to sync by checking the boxes next to them
> 4. Click **Add to Sync** in the top right
>
> **Tip:** You can select multiple products at once to save time.
>
> You'll see a confirmation message when your products are added. They'll appear in ChatGPT within 15 minutes.

### Good Troubleshooting Section

> ## My Products Aren't Appearing in ChatGPT
>
> If your products aren't showing up in ChatGPT after syncing, here are the most common causes:
>
> ### Your sync is still processing
>
> Syncs can take up to 15 minutes to complete. Check the **Sync Status** on your dashboard. If it shows "In Progress," wait a few more minutes.
>
> ### Your products are set to "Draft" in WooCommerce
>
> Floxen only syncs published products. In WooCommerce, make sure your products have a status of "Published."
>
> ### Your Store connection was interrupted
>
> Go to **Settings** → **Store Connection** and verify your Store shows as "Connected." If not, click **Reconnect**.
>
> If you've tried these steps and your products still aren't appearing, contact us by Chat or at support@floxen.com.
