# What is Floxen and how does it work?

Floxen connects your WooCommerce Store to ChatGPT, so your products can appear when shoppers ask ChatGPT for recommendations. This article explains what Floxen does and how it works.

## What is Floxen?

ChatGPT has a built-in shopping feature that helps millions of people discover products through conversation. When someone asks ChatGPT "What's a good running shoe under $100?" or "Find me a birthday gift for my mom," ChatGPT can recommend products from stores that have connected their catalogs.

**Floxen makes it easy for your WooCommerce Store to be one of those stores.**

Without Floxen, getting your products into ChatGPT requires technical work: building product feeds, formatting data to meet specifications, and keeping everything up to date. Floxen handles all of that for you automatically.

## How does Floxen work?

Getting your products into ChatGPT takes four steps:

### 1. Connect your Store

Enter your WooCommerce Store URL and authorize Floxen to access your product catalog. This takes about 30 seconds and doesn't require installing any plugins.

**Tip:** Floxen only accesses your products. We never access your orders, customers, or coupons.

### 2. Select your products

Choose which products you want to appear in ChatGPT. Depending on your plan, you can sync 5, 100, or unlimited products.

### 3. Configure field mappings

Floxen needs to know how your WooCommerce product data should appear in ChatGPT. Field mapping connects your WooCommerce fields (like product name, price, and description) to the format ChatGPT expects.

Floxen sets up default mappings automatically, but you can customize them if needed.

### 4. Activate your feed

Once you've configured your Store profile and reviewed your products, activate your feed. Your products will be submitted to ChatGPT and typically appear within a few days.

## What happens after setup?

Once your feed is active, Floxen keeps your products up to date automatically:

- **Hourly sync** - Floxen checks your WooCommerce Store every hour for changes to prices, inventory, descriptions, and images
- **Automatic updates** - When you update a product in WooCommerce, the change syncs to ChatGPT automatically
- **No manual work** - You don't need to re-upload anything or manage feeds yourself

---

## What information does Floxen sync?

Floxen syncs product information that helps shoppers discover and understand your products:

- Product title and description
- Price and sale price
- Images
- Inventory and availability
- Categories
- Attributes (like size and color)

Floxen also includes your Store information (your store name, return policy, and return window) so shoppers know what to expect.

## What Floxen doesn't access

Floxen only reads your product catalog. We never access:

- Customer orders
- Customer information
- Coupons or discounts
- Payment details

Your Store data stays private.
